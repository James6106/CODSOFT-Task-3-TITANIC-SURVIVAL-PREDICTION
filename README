🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction
📌 Project Overview
This beginner-friendly machine learning project uses the historical Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic. By analyzing features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare, the model uncovers patterns in survival and explores the impact of socio-economic factors.
🎯 Objective
- Build a classification model to predict survival outcomes
- Apply foundational machine learning techniques to real-world data
- Explore how different variables influence survival probability
🧰 Tools & Techniques
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering (e.g., encoding categorical variables, handling missing values)
- Classification Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix
📊 Dataset Details
- Features include: Age, Gender, Ticket Class, Fare, Cabin, Embarked
- Target variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset
✅ Outcomes
- Visualize survival rates across demographics
- Compare model performances and feature importances
- Develop a reliable model for predicting passenger survival
